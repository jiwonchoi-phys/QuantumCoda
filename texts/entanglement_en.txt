Quantum entanglement is a very strange physical phenomenon, that occurs when a pair or group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others. Also, this phenomenon has not yet been well understood, but it is transmitted 'at the same time' regardless of distance, without considering the speed of light. In other words, any information was transmitted can takes time, but it ignores that. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics.

In our game 'Quantum Coda', we applied the 'entanglement' phenomenon as a same number exist in two different tiles at the same time. For example, when the number of a tile is designated as (1,4), the other one has (2,4), etc. If you choose a tile of (1,4) and guess the number 4, then this number 4 affects (1,4) and (2,4) as well. We'll explain this on the Measurements & Collapses tab. For more detailed explanation, please refer to 'Game Rules'.
